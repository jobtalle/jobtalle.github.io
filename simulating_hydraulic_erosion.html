This is mostly caused by rainfall, but also by ocean waves hitting the shore and the flow of rivers. Figure 1 shows the considerable effects that a small stream has had on the rocky environment around it. When creating realistically looking environments, the effects of erosion need to be accounted for. I have experimented with procedural terrain generation before to generate scenes for <a href="layered_voxel_rendering.html" target="_blank">layered voxel rendering</a> and to demonstrate <a href="cubic_noise.html" target="_blank">cubic noise</a>. These terrains were very basic and did not account for erosion. Therefore, they lack a lot of detail, making them unrealistic at closer inspection.</p><figure title="A small waterfall">    <img src="posts/2020_5_20/img/waterfall.jpg">    <figcaption>Figure 1: A small waterfall.</figcaption></figure><p>In this article, I will detail a simple and fast method that approximates the effects of hydraulic erosion. The aim of this method is to create believable environments rather than reaching a high degree of realism. Fidelity may be sacrificed for the sake of speed, as long as the results look natural. Summarized, the method should do the following:</p><ul>    <li>The results must look <em>natural</em>.</li>    <li>The algorithm must be <em>simple</em>.</li>    <li>The algorithm must be <em>fast</em>.</li>    <li>The algorithm should simulate hydraulic erosion caused by <em>rainfall</em> and <em>rivers</em>.</li></ul><h2>Multiple approaches</h2><p>There are several different approaches when it comes to simulating erosion. All methods simulate the same phenomenon: water moving from high places to low places, eroding terrain as it flows, and depositing sediment as they go further down their paths. This process always results in a number of recognizable terrain features like gulleys and valleys where rivers flow, deltas where they meet their destination and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluvial_fan" target="_blank">alluvial fans</a> where smaller streams combine into bigger rivers. While reading about this topic, I have encountered the following distinct strategies in research literature:</p><ul>    <li>Erosion is simulated by keeping track of where water is for every position on the terrain. A grid (or 2D array) is created for the environment, and water levels and pressures are kept for every cell. When updating, the pressures determine where the water flows to. While flowing, water moves sediment around.</li>    <li>Erosion is simulated by dropping many particles simulating raindrops on the terrain. The particles then move down the slopes of the terrain. They can bring sediment with them or deposit it.</li></ul><p>Mostly for performance reasons, I've chosen to implement a drop based method. Because most drops don't flow very far, many inactive drop simulations can be terminated early and the bulk of the processing power will go to the drops that actually carve out terrain features. The grid based simulation will need to simulate every part on the terrain for every update cycle.</p><h2>Snowballs</h2><p>The drops in the simulation can be seen as <em>snowballs</em> instead of raindrops. Within the context of the simulation, I believe this is a better analogy. The snowballs start small when they are dropped, but gain more material as they roll down the hills. When they become too big, they start shedding material as they go. When they stop rolling in valleys or in the sea, the snowballs fall apart and leave their material on the terrain.</p><p>The complete erosion algorithm can be read below. This code uses a <code class="prettyprint lang-js">heightMap</code> object to erode. This height map can be read from and written to, and the <code class="prettyprint lang-js">sampleNormal</code> function can be used to get the surface normal. This is a 3D vector pointing upwards from the terrain, so it can be used to determine the slope direction and steepness.</p><pre class="prettyprint noscroll">/**

        // If the terrain is flat, stop simulating, the snowball cannot roll any further
        if (surfaceNormal.y === 1)
            break;

        // Calculate the deposition and erosion rate
        const deposit = sediment * depositionRate * surfaceNormal.y;
        const erosion = erosionRate * (1 - surfaceNormal.y) * Math.min(1, i * iterationScale);

        heightMap.change(xp, yp, deposit - erosion);
