The result is a universal platform physics engine suitable for any platformer. This implementation uses edge collisions instead of cell collisions, which allows for more compact level design.</p></div><div class="post-link"><div class="post-link-preview"><a href="cubic_noise.html"><img src="posts/2017_10_31/img/preview.jpg" title="Cubic noise"></a></div><h1><a href="cubic_noise.html">Cubic noise</a></h1><span class="date">31 Oct 2017</span><p>Coherent random noise can be used to create a great variety of effects. The algorithm for generating cubic noise is explained. An interactive cubic noise generator is inclued, as well as a procedural terrain generator.</p></div>
