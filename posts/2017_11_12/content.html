<h2>Natural patterns</h2>
<p>Lindenmayer systems were originally conceived by Hungarian biologist Aristid Lindenmayer while studying algae growth. He developed L-systems as a way to describe the growth process. The result was a type of language in which these recursive properties can be expressed. Indeed, L-systems can be used to generate natural patterns, but well known mathematical patterns can also be written as an L-system. I will show examples of both cases in this article.</p>
<p>The language is very simple. It consists of symbols (the alphabet) and rules. The first state of the sentence is called the <em>axiom</em>. The rules can be applied repeatedly on this axiom to obtain a complex system. A simple example would be a system with the axiom <code>A</code>, and the rule <code>A = ABA</code>. After the first iteration (the first time the rule is applied), the sentence will be changed to <code>ABA</code>. After the second iteration, the sentence will be <code>ABABABA</code> and so forth. You can see how a self expanding sentence can be analogous to cell division in plants and other biological processes.</p>

<h2>Rendering sentences</h2>
<p>After a system has been defined and iterated, we have a large sentence with interesting properties. To visualize these properties, a method to render them needs to be devised. In this article, I render the system using turtle graphics.</p>
<p>Turtle graphics are rendered by placing a "turtle" on a cartesian plane and passing instructions to this turtle. The turtle moves according to the instructions it receives. In this case, every symbol from an L-system sentence is sent to the turtle. In the short example above, my sentence is a bit simple. It only contains letters. It is hard to translate a string of letters to interesting turtle instructions. Therefore, special symbols are defined to encode turtle commands. Figure 1 shows the key for my turtle language.</p>
<p>I added an interactive L-system renderer below. A number of examples are provided, but custom systems can be defined for up to six rules. Note that I added the field <em>constants</em>, which can contain a string of symbols. When the turtle renders a string, symbols that are constants will be ignored. Symbols that are constants are still subject to the rules. The field <em>angle</em> denotes the number of degrees the turtle will rotate when either <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> is encountered. In the rule fields, the constant <code>AXIOM</code> can be used. It will be replaced by the original axiom. This is used in several examples.</p>

<p>The source code for this javascript example can be found <a href="https://github.com/jobtalle/LindenmayerSystems" target="_blank">in this repository</a>. The provided example systems show some possibilities of Lindenmayer systems, ranging from noisy random-like patterns to rigid geometric patterns. All systems show self-similarity; when the number of iterations becomes high, the small details they produce are no longer noticable. In theory however, one could zoom in indefinitely while increasing precision along the way. This is a well known property of <em>fractals</em>. Zooming in on fractals will often uncover patterns that were also visible at larger scales.</p>
