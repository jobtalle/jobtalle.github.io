<h2>Natural patterns</h2>
<p>Lindenmayer systems were originally conceived by Hungarian biologist Aristid Lindenmayer while studying algae growth. He developed L-systems as a way to describe the growth process. The result was a type of language in which these recursive properties can be expressed. Indeed, L-systems can be used to generate natural patterns, but well known mathematical patterns can also be written as an L-system. I will show examples of both cases in this article.</p>
<p>The language is very simple. It consists of symbols (the alphabet) and rules. The first state of the sentence is called the <em>axiom</em>. The rules can be applied repeatedly on this axiom to obtain a complex system. A simple example would be a system with the axiom <em>A</em>, and the rule <em>A = ABA</em>. After the first iteration (the first time the rule is applied), the sentence will be changed to <em>ABA</em>. After the second iteration, the sentence will be <em>ABABABA</em> and so forth. You can see how a self expanding sentence can be analogous to cell division in plants and other biological processes.</p>

			<td><pre>]</pre></td>
			<td>Pop the last pushed turtle position from the stack and move the turtle to this position</td>
		</tr>

<h2>Rendering sentences</h2>
<p>After a system has been defined and iterated, we have a large sentence with interesting properties. To make these properties visible, a way to render such a sentence is defined. In this article, I render the system using turtle graphics.</p>
<p>Turtle graphics are rendered by placing a "turtle" on a cartesian plane, and passing instructions to the turtle. The turtle moves according to the instructions it receives. In this case, every symbol from an L-system sentence is sent to the turtle. In the short example in the previous paragraph, my sentence is a bit simple. It only contains letters. It is hard to translate a string of letters into interesting turtle instructions. Therefore, special symbols are defined to encode turtle commands. Figure 1 shows the key for my turtle language.</p>
