<h2>Coherent random noise</h2>
<p>Coherent random noise is random noise which is not totally random; in other words, adjecent values in coherent random noise have some relation to each other, but the noise as a whole is random. An example of pure random noise is white noise, which is produced by a TV if no cable is plugged in. The noise is totally random, no patterns can be recognized. A cloudy sky is an example of coherent random noise. The pattern of clouds cannot be predicted, but the clouds themselves form recognizable features.</p>

<p>Random noise is often used to produce pseudorandom effects in software. A notable example is terrain in games. 2D coherent random noise is produced, and the values are interpreted as a heightmap. An interactive demonstration of this technique can be found <a href="#applications">further down</a>.</p>
<h2>Cubic noise</h2>
<p><a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a> shows an example of <i>cubic noise</i>. Cubic noise is essentially scaled up white noise with cubic interpolation. Cubic interpolation ensures the result is smoothed enough to remove grid like artifacts. The values are based on coordinates, every pixel in this example represents a set of coordinates. These coordinate values can be tiled to make a tiling noise texture.</p>
<p>The algorithm for cubic noise can be found in <a href="https://www.github.com/jobtalle/CubicNoise" target="_blank">this repository</a>. Implementations for several programming languages are included. The algorithm is very simple, so it can easily be ported to other programming languages.</p>

<h2>Octaves & falloff</h2>
<p>The example in <a href="#figure1">figure 1</a> shows some small scale detail, instead of just large smooth gradients. This is achieved by adding several <i>octaves</i> to the noise. The first octave has the largest influence and the largest scale. Every next octave has smaller influence and a finer scale than its predecessor. This process is shown in <a href="#figure2">figure 2</a>.</p>
<p>Adding octaves proposes a challenge. It is important that the sum of all octave influences is one; if this is not the case, the resulting noise will probably be either too dark or oversaturated. I define falloff $f$ as the number each successive octave influence is divided by. For example, if $f = 2$, the initial influence is $\frac{1}{f}$, the next influence is $\frac{\frac{1}{f}}{f}$ and so forth.</p>
<p>The number of octaves is defined as $o_{total}$. If $o_{total} = 3$, the total influence will be $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}$. Unfortunately, this does not sum up to one. To normalize the total influence, the initial influence $i$ needs to be multiplied by the swapped fraction of the total sum (since $\frac{x}{y} * \frac{y}{x} = 1$), which is $\frac{8}{7}$ in this example. I call this normalizer $n$. Initial influence $i$ can now be defined as $i = \frac{1}{f} * n$, which leads to</p>
<p>$$\sum_{o=1}^{o_{total}} \frac{1}{{f} ^ {o}} * n = 1$$</p>
<p>If $n$ can be calculated from falloff and octaves, we have a general formula that yields an initial influence $i$ which will lead to the sum of all octaves being one. Luckily, this is possible using the following formula:</p>
<p>$$i = \frac{\frac{(f - 1) * {f} ^ {o_{total}}}{{f} ^ {o_{total}} - 1}}{f}$$</p>
<p>Of course the formula for influence will not work when $f = 1$ or $f = 0$. If $f = 1$, $i = \frac{1}{o_{total}}$, since every octave has the same influence. The second case shouldn't occur, because $f = 0$ makes no sense; the influence of every next octave would be infinitely larger than the previous one.</p>
