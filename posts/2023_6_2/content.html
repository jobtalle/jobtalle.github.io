<h2>Textures with transparency</h2>
<p>Textures and sprite with (partially) transparent pixels are often used in computer graphics to add detail to 3D assets that's not in the model itself. Foliage rendering often makes use of textures containing many grass blades, instead of modelling every grass blade individually. This has performance benefits and allows the artist to add lots of small details to the scenery.</p>

<p>Contrary to 3D models, the edges of these details become jagged and pixelated when zoomed in. If you look close enough, the separate pixels can be told apart. This can be mitigated by using higher resolution assets, but this hurts performance. To fix this problem, this article goes into generating <em>signed distance fields</em>, which can be used instead of pixel alpha values to define shapes on an image. This technique was popularized by Valve <a target="_blank" href="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf">with this paper</a>, who used it for <em>glyphs</em> and fonts in Team Fortress 2. Nowadays, the technique is often used for rendering text in real time graphics when rendering vector graphics is too slow.</p>
<p>Using SDFs over the alpha channel for transparency has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Smooth shape outlines which don't ever become pixelated when magnified</li>
    <li>The SDF data fits into the alpha channel of a texture, so no new data needs to be allocated.</li>
    <li>SDFs are very fast to use. They won't degrade performance.</li>
    <li>The technique allows for <em>anti aliasing</em> the edges it describes, which is not possible with normal transparency.</li>
    <li>SDFs retain fidelity even at low resolutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 1 shows a low resolution (125 by 125 pixels) texture of the <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1518810/Koi_Farm/">Koi Farm</a> logo which contains a signed distance field in its alpha channel. The part inside the black circle uses this data to reconstruct smooth edges.</p>
<p>There are drawbacks too:</p>
<ul>
    <li>SDFs can only store information about fully opaque shapes. There can't be partially transparent pixels on a texture that contains a SDF in its alpha channel.</li>
    <li>SDFs need to be generated using a higher resolution version of the asset. This is only a problem if the input image is a raster image, since vector images can always be magnified.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Signed distance fields</h2>
<p>Signed distance field calculate for every pixel on the output image how far the center of that pixel is removed from the actual edge from the image. This is either a positive or a negative distance, since a pixel can be either inside or outside the shape described by the SDF. That's why the distance field is signed. If the distance towards the edge is negative the pixel is outside the shape, and if it's possible the distance is positive.</p>
<p>Because pixel opacity is stored in just one byte, this value is stored in the range $[0, 1]$ just like the three other color channel values are stored, where $0.5$ is the edge, so if the distance is $<0.5$, a pixel is outside the shape.</p>
<p>Rendering textures with SDFs is therefore fairly straightforward; the texture can be sampled normally using linear interpolation (and mipmapping if mipmaps are generated), and the alpha value is interpreted as the signed distance. If it is lower than $0.5$, the pixel should not be rendered, and if it is larger, the pixel should be opaque.</p>
<h2>Generating SDFs</h2>
<p>To generate SDFs, I have created an online tool called <a target="_blank" href="https://jobtalle.com/SDFMaker/"><em>SDF maker</em></a>. It takes either raster images or vector images and converts them to images with SDFs with a configurable output resolution and SDF radius. This paragraph explains how the tool was developed. The source code for this tool is released <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jobtalle/SDFMaker">on GitHub</a> under the MIT license.</p>
<p>While generating assets using tooling and shipping generated assets works well, it may also be useful to generate signed distance fields at runtime. Luckily, the algorithms used by this tool are fast enough to use live.</p>
<p>SDF maker requires a high resolution version of the texture that needs to be exported with a SDF. The resolution must be higher, because the SDF essentially stores a higher resolution shape than the lower resolution could otherwise contain. The algorithm performs the following steps to produce the lower resolution image with a SDF:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The high resolution source image is read.</li>
    <li>The algorithm creates two <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram"><em>Voronoi diagrams</em></a> using the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_flooding_algorithm"><em>Jump Flooding Algorithm</em></a>, one seeded with all opaque pixels and another one seeded with all transparent pixels. These Voronoi diagrams store the coordinates of both the nearest opaque and the nearest transparent pixel for every pixel.</li>
    <li>A color texture is created. This texture has the same resolution as the input image, but every transparent pixel stores the color of the nearest opaque pixel instead. This is crucial for mipmapping, as explained in the next paragraph. Figure 2 shows how this color texture looks.</li>
    <li>Mipmaps are generated for the color texture, which is then downscaled and rendered to the output image in the output resolution using mipmapping for downscaling.</li>
    <li>The distance to the edge is calculated from the Voronoi diagrams and stored on the output image. For every transparent pixel, the distance to the nearest opaque pixel is queried from the diagram, and every opaque pixels reads the distance to the nearest transparent pixel.</li>
</ol>
<p>The radius of the stored distance can be changed as well. If rendering a shape is enough, the radius can be $1$, since no extra information is needed. If the rendered textures need an outline of several pixels wide, the SDF radius can be increased to store enough information for outlines.</p>
