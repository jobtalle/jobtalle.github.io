<h2>Symmetry</h2>
<p>In real time rendering, the most common application for symmetry is probably reflection rendering. In this context, a mirror that produces the reflection is the <em>symmetry plane</em>, and a symmetrical version of all the things that are in front of the mirror are then also rendered behind the mirror.</p>
<p>In really, mirrors don't really intersect objects, but there is no reason they can't do that when rendering a digital scene. In fact, multiple mirrors can exist that can also intersect each other. In this article, a shader algorithm is explained that can apply symmetry to a mesh using any number of symmetry planes (or mirrors), that can intersect both the geometry and other symmetry planes. This can result in very interesting and exotic geometries that are unrecognizable from the original geometry that has been used as source material.</p>

<h2>A simple case</h2>
<p>Figure 1 shows a simple case of symmetry. The blue cube is mirrored along the vertical axis in the image, towards the left. A mirrored version of the cube appears on the left.</p>
<h2>Repeated application</h2>
<p>Figure 2 shows another application of a symmetry plane; additionally to the horizontal mirroring, the cube is now also mirrored along the horizontal axis, creating four (partial) cubes.</p>
<p>Without symmetry, one cube is rendered. With one symmetry plane, two cubes are rendered, and with two planes, four cubes are rendered. The number of times the original primitive is rendered is equal to $2^p$ where $p$ is the number of symmetry planes.</p>
