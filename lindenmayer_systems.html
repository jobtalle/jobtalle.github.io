<p>Lindenmayer systems were originally conceived by Hungarian biologist Aristid Lindenmayer while studying algae growth. He developed L-systems as a way to describe the growth process. The result was a type of language in which these recursive properties can be expressed. Indeed, L-systems can be used to generate natural patterns, but well known mathematical patterns can also be written as an L-system. I will show examples of both cases in this article.</p>
<p>The language is very simple. It consists of symbols (the alphabet) and production rules. The first state of the sentence is called the <em>axiom</em>. The production rules can be applied repeatedly on this axiom to obtain a complex system. A simple example would be a system with the axiom $A$, and the rule $A \to ABA$. After the first iteration (the first time the rule is applied), the sentence will be changed to $ABA$. After the second iteration, the sentence will be $ABABABA$ and so forth. You can see how a self expanding sentence can be analogous to cell division in plants and other biological processes.</p>

<h2>Rendering sentences</h2>
<p>After a system has been defined and iterated, we have a large sentence with interesting properties. To visualize these properties, a method to render them needs to be devised. In this article, I render the system using turtle graphics.</p>
<p>Turtle graphics are rendered by placing a "turtle" on a cartesian plane and passing instructions to this turtle. The turtle moves according to the instructions it receives. In this case, every symbol from an L-system sentence is sent to the turtle. In the short example above, my sentence is a bit simple. It only contains letters. It is hard to translate a string of letters to interesting turtle instructions. Therefore, special symbols are defined to encode turtle commands. Figure 1 shows the key for my turtle language.</p>
<p>I added an interactive L-system renderer below. A number of examples are provided, but custom systems can be defined for up to six production rules. Note that I added the field <em>constants</em>, which can contain a string of symbols. When the turtle renders a string, symbols that are constants will be ignored. Symbols that are constants are still subject to the rules. The field <em>angle</em> denotes the number of degrees the turtle will rotate when either <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> is encountered. In the rule fields, the constant <code>AXIOM</code> can be used. It will be replaced by the original axiom. This is used in several examples.</p>

<p>The source code for this javascript example can be found <a href="https://github.com/jobtalle/LindenmayerSystems" target="_blank">in this repository</a>. The provided example systems show some possibilities of Lindenmayer systems, ranging from noisy random-like patterns to rigid geometric patterns. All systems show self-similarity; when the number of iterations becomes high, the small details they produce are no longer noticable. In theory however, one could zoom in indefinitely while increasing precision along the way. This is a well known property of <em>fractals</em>. Zooming in on fractals will often uncover patterns that were also visible at larger scales.</p>
<h2>Adding dimensions</h2>
<p>The example above is fully capable of demonstrating Lindenmayer systems, but I'd like to add a few features to make the algorithm more powerful. I'm personally very interested in using L-systems to generate plants and natural systems. A very interesting source of information I've used for this research is <a href="http://algorithmicbotany.org/" target="_blank">the website of the Biological Modeling and Visualization research group</a> at the university of Calgary. There are many papers available on this topic, which can be found at their website.</p>
<p>I'd like to keep my system as simple as possible, but I am missing some features I need to make more complex systems. I would like to model at least the following things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Some degree of randomization should be possible, because I assume some form randomness exists in nature</li>
	<li>I want symbols to be able to keep track of their age, since cells in nature may also behave differently depending on age</li>
	<li>Production rules should take symbol context into account</li>
	<li>I want to keep track of the distance to the root cell</li>
	<li>The turtle should move in three dimensions to allow for more complex shapes</li>
</ul>
<p>The age feature is especially useful for plant modelling. I could for example make a rule which will only be applied to cells between 3 and 4 iterations old, or I could only let young plant parts develop while keeping the old stem of the plant bare. Another extra possibility is defining a thickness graph for rendering; the age will determine the thickness of a rendered cell.</p>
<p>The distance to the root helps modelling a well known property of plants. The water and nutrients in a plant can only be transported for a limited distance. I can stop developing new branches when not enough nutrients can be transported to that point. Finally, plants that are too high can easily break under the influence of wind. I can use the distance to the root to determine how "strong" a plant is when confronted with weather and prevent plants from developing weak structures.</p>

<h2>Parametric grammar</h2>
<p>To facilitate the new features, I need to extend my alphabet and syntax. Figure 2 shows the key for this new system. The new symbols in this table are rotation symbols required for moving the turtle in 3D space.</p>
<p>Randomness can easily be modelled by adding multiple ambiguous production rules for the same symbol. When multiple rules exist for a symbol, a random one is chosen.</p>
<p>To model cell age and distance to root, I <em>could</em> add two variables to each symbol. If I would then like to add more properties, I need to add more variables. This is not very flexible and oddly specific. Luckily, a general solution is available: parametric L-systems. In parametric L-systems, each symbol is succeeded by a list of parameters (if it has any). Production rules may only be valid for symbols with a specific set of parameters or for certain conditions of these parameters, and the symbols resulting from the rule can have parameters too.</p>
<p>I will demonstrate this new system with an example of a symbol with one parameter, which is its age in iterations. Suppose the axiom is $A(0)$, and one production rule $A(x) \to A(x + 1)$. For every iteration, every symbol $A$ will have its parameter increased by one. Now I want to change every $A$ to a $B$ when it is eight iterations old. The production rule for this would be $A(x) : x == 8 \to B$. If I would define the production rule $A(x, y) \to C$ for the described system, it would never fire; no $A$ with more than one parameter can exist in this sytem. Note that $x$ and $y$ in these examples are chosen arbitrarily; they are used to do something with the values of the first parameters. These parameters have no specific names, $x$ and $y$ are just variables and can be any symbol.</p>
<p>I have now added two syntax rules to the language; brackets behind a symbol contain a number of parameters separated by commas, and the first operand of a production rule can be succeeded by a $:$ symbol if it should only fire when the condition after this symbol is met.</p>
<h2>Context sensitive grammar</h2>
<p>The system is almost complete. One last thing I would like to encode is context. The context of a symbol should be able to influence what rules are applied to it. I could in theory encode context in symbol parameters, but this would result in a very complex system of rules and encodings. Instead, I add one last syntax rule to the production methods. Suppose I have a sentence of several instances of $A(x)$ where $x$ varies between symbols. I want to make a context sensitive production rule which changes $A$ to $B$ only if $A$ is surrounded by other instances of $A$ whose parameters are equal; in other words, there must be an $A$ on the left and an $A$ on the right with the same parameter values. The production rule looks like this:</p>
<p>$$A(x) < A(y) > A(z) : x == z \to B$$</p>
<p>So the final addition to the grammar are the $<$ and $>$ symbols. If the left operand of a production rule is preceeded by $<$, it requires the symbol before $<$ as context. If it is succeeded by $>$, it requires the symbol after $>$ as context. Production rules can also have no required context or only left or only right context.</p>
