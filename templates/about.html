<p>My name is Job Talle and I'm a freelance software developer, consultant and programming enthusiast. I run a company focusing on software engineering with a specialization in artificial intelligence. I'm also co founder of a game developers cooperative in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Groningen" target="_blank">Groningen</a> called the <a href="https://www.gamebakery.nl" target="_blank">Game Bakery</a>, where approximately twenty-five game development related companies share an office, organize events and take on projects together. Since 2015, I'm also involved in organizing the yearly <a href="https://www.globalgamejamgroningen.nl/" target="_blank">Global Game Jam in Groningen</a>.</p>
<p>I have broad experience with many programming languages and technologies, preferably mixed with graphics programming, data visualization and simulations. I have studied Artificial Intelligence at the <a href="https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en" target="_blank">University of Groningen</a>, where I also taught a computer graphics course.</p>
<p>This website was built to write about interesting topics I encounter during my work and studies. The posts are also meant to elaborate further on open source software that I publish on <a href="https://github.com/jobtalle" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
