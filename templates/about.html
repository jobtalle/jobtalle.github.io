<h1>About</h1>
<p>My name is Job Talle and I'm a freelance software developer, consultant and programming enthusiast. I currently live and work in Groningen, a small city in the Netherlands. I run a company focusing on both game development and artificial intelligence, which are the fields I'm most passionate about. I'm also co founder of a local game developers cooperative in Groningen called the <a href="https://gamebakery.nl" target="_blank">Game Bakery</a>, where about twenty game related companies share an office building, organizing events and taking on projects together.</p>
<p>I have broad experience with many programming languages and techniques. Some of my favourites are C, C++, Java and Javascript, preferably mixed with graphics programming.</p>
<p>I have built this website to write about interesting topics I encounter during my work and studies. The posts are also meant to elaborate further on open source software that I post on <a href="https://github.com/jobtalle" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
